# Android Holo Font-Icons

![enter image description here][1]

A font-family that packages the Android Holo monochromatic icons from the [Action Bar Icon Pack][2] listed on the [Iconography][3] page of the Android Developer's style guide.

The package is generated with [fontello][4] and can be edited by loading in the web interface the `config.json` file to edit the icons collection, class prefix and individual class names to your liking.

They can be used for prototyping in graphic editors by installing them as system font, or included in any web or phonegap project with the complementary CSS maps.

A demo page with all the icons and identifying classe is included, it's also live on [simonerescio.it][5]
